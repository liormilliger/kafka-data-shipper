You are 100% correct, and you've hit on the central "chicken-and-egg" problem of CI/CD and integration testing.

Your insight is exactly right:

1.  `mvn install` (which includes the `test` phase) for both `producer` and `consumer` **requires a running MySQL database.**
2.  `mvn install` for `consumer` **also requires a running Kafka cluster.**
3.  You can't build the Docker images until the `*.jar` files are successfully created by `mvn install`.

My previous instructions to "build the Jars first" were incomplete. You've correctly identified that you can't build them if the services they depend on (for their *tests*) aren't running.

-----

### The Solution: The CI/CD Mindset

The standard solution is to **separate the *build* from the *test***.

  * **Building:** The goal is just to compile the code and create the `*.jar` artifact. We don't need to run the integration tests for this.
  * **Testing:** This is a separate step that happens in an environment *with* all the services (like Kafka and MySQL) running.

For your goal (getting the images into Kubernetes), we will use a Maven flag to **skip the tests** just to get the `*.jar` files built. This is a very common practice in CI pipelines.

Here is the corrected, step-by-step orchestration.

-----

### The Correct Kubernetes Orchestration

#### Step 1: Build Artifacts (JARs) by Skipping Tests

This is the key step you were missing. We will force Maven to build the JARs without running the tests that depend on Kafka and MySQL.

Run these commands from your `~/devops-test` directory:

```bash
# 1. Build common (this has no tests, but good practice)
mvn install -f ./common

# 2. Build producer, skipping the tests
mvn install -f ./producer -DskipTests

# 3. Build consumer, skipping the tests
mvn install -f ./consumer -DskipTests
```

  * `DskipTests`: This flag tells Maven "compile my code, package the JAR, and put it in the `target/` folder, but do *not* run the test suite."

Now you will have the needed JARs:

  * `./producer/target/producer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`
  * `./consumer/target/consumer-0.0.1-SNAPSHOT.jar`

-----

#### Step 2: Build and Push Your Docker Images

Now that the JARs exist, your `docker build` commands will work. (Remember to replace `your-registry` with your Docker Hub username or ECR path).

```bash
# 1. Build the images
docker build -t your-registry/producer:latest ./producer
docker build -t your-registry/consumer:latest ./consumer

# 2. Push them to the registry
docker push your-registry/producer:latest
docker push your-registry/consumer:latest
```

-----

#### Step 3: Deploy the Environment (MySQL & Kafka)

Now, on your Kubernetes cluster, you create the services that your applications will talk to.

1.  **Create the Kafka namespace:**

    ```bash
    kubectl create namespace kafka
    ```

2.  **Deploy Strimzi (Kafka) Operator:**

    ```bash
    helm repo add strimzi https://strimzi.io/charts/
    helm install strimzi-operator strimzi/strimzi-kafka-operator -n kafka
    ```

3.  **Deploy MySQL and Load `init.sql`:**

      * First, add your `init.sql` script as a ConfigMap in the `kafka` namespace:
        ```bash
        kubectl create configmap mysql-init-cm --from-file=init.sql -n kafka
        ```
      * Now, install MySQL using the Bitnami Helm chart and tell it to use your script. (This is much cleaner than running it manually).
        ```bash
        helm repo add bitnami https://charts.bitnami.com/bitnami
        helm install mysql bitnami/mysql -n kafka \
          --set auth.database=Payoneer \
          --set auth.username=payoneer_user \
          --set auth.password=your_strong_password_here \
          --set initdbScriptsConfigMap=mysql-init-cm
        ```

4.  **Deploy your Kafka Cluster:**

      * Wait a minute for the Strimzi operator and the MySQL pod to be "Running".
      * Apply your Kafka cluster YAML:
        ```bash
        kubectl apply -f my-kafka-cluster.yaml -n kafka
        ```

-----

#### Step 4: Deploy Your Applications

Now that your database (with its data) and your Kafka cluster are running, you can finally deploy your applications. They will start up and successfully connect to the services.

1.  Create and apply your `producer-deployment.yaml`, `producer-service.yaml`, and `consumer-deployment.yaml` files (as shown in my previous answer).
2.  The `env:` section of those YAMLs will tell them the service names (`mysql`, `my-cluster-kafka-plain-bootstrap:9092`) and credentials to use.

This order—**Build Jars (skip tests) \> Build Images \> Deploy Services \> Deploy Apps**—solves the chicken-and-egg problem and is the standard workflow.
